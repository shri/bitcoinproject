Bitcoin is gaining a lot of attention throughout the world, especially with the tech community, and I think it makes perfect sense for a company like Best Buy to accept Bitcoin as payment. 
 
A small number of businesses have began accepting bitcoin as payment in the last year and the bitcoin community has responed very positively. Some drive 100 miles or more out of their way to support these businesses that have decided to become some of the first to embrace this amazing currency.
 
I know that I would begin shopping at Best buy again just to have an excuse to use my favorite currency, and many others would as well.
 
If you implement it with a service like BitPay which eliminates any risk involved with the volatility of the bitcoin market.
 
I truly feel there would be huge advantages to being on the early side of this and begin accepting bitcoin before the majority of other businesses do.
